  title: Vapp Consumer API
  description: |
    The Vapp Consumer API operates between a Vapp server and the remote billing/provisioning system. Its main purpose is
    to provide Authorization and Accounting services, for the Cloudonix.io platform subscribers, providers (carriers) and
    other interconnected services.
    <br/><br/>
    A possible work flow for the API shall be as the following:<br/>

      1. `/call/state/{session_id}/NEW_SESSION` - Indicate a new session is now starting
      2. `/call/authorize/outbound/{session_id}` - A call is trying to leave a mobile device and receive services, authorize
      this request or reject it
      3. `/call/state/{session_id}/RINGING` - Call is ringing at the remote end
      4. `/call/state/{session_id}/ANSWER` - Remote party had answered the call
      5. `/call/cdr/{session_id}` - Call detail records for billing purposes
    <br/><br/>

    The `/call/ivr` method is used for activating the internal IVR handler, capable of building various IVR flows, without the
    neeed to provide any internal platform development.

      summary: |
        Authorize a mobile originated call for services
      description: |
        Query the remote management system to authorize the current mobile
        originated call to receive services. The objective is to authorize the
        call, classify it and provide additional information for processing.
        <br/>
        When a call originated from a remote mobile application, it must first
        be authorized for services. Depending on your usage, authorization
        factors may vary (financial, services, profile, etc). The information
        provided to Cloudonix basically indicated how the outbound call should
        be handled and how to pass it to the respective carriers.

        ## A sample result may be the following:

        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "external",
          "numbers": [
            "12127773456"
            ],
          "caller_id": "972123456789",
          "recording": 1,
          "recording_url": "http://my.remote.server.upload.url",
          "lcr": [
            {
              "prefix": "9999",
              "host": "192.168.100.1",
              "port": "5060",
              "name": "carrier_1",
              "code": "carrier_1",
              "ppm": 0.04
            },
            {
              "prefix": "9999",
              "host": "192.168.100.1",
              "port": "5060",
              "name": "carrier_1",
              "code": "carrier_1",
              "ppm": 0.04
            }
            ]
          }
        ```

        ## Why is `numbers` and array, and not a string?
        If **`calltype`** equals **`internal`**, a list of possible endpoints may be provided. Internal endpoints are dialled accordingly to the **`policy`** variable. For internal call routing, the following sample shoud be referred.

        <br/>
        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "internal",
          "policy": "ringall",
          "numbers": [
            "12127773456",
            "12127777777"
            ],
          "caller_id": "972123456789",
          "recording": 1,
          "calllimit": 1234
          "recording_url": "http://my.remote.server.upload.url",
          }
        ```
        ## What are `service` calls?
        When a call should be routed to a service, this indicates that the call is handled by a special service (eg. Voicemail).
        The following example should be referred to.
        <br/>
        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "service",
          "numbers": [
            "12127773456"
            ],
          "caller_id": "972123456789",
          "recording": 1,
          "recording_url": "http://my.remote.server.upload.url",
          "calllimit": 1234
          "lcr": [
            {
              "prefix": "",
              "host": "192.168.100.1",
              "port": "5060",
              "name": "service_voicemail",
              "code": "service_voicemail",
              "ppm": 0.00
            },
          }
        ```

        ## Examples Responses
        #### Route the call to a SIP endpoint (mobile application or hardware phone)
        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "internal",
          "endpoints": [
            "12127773456@subscribers.gateway:5060",
            "12127777777@subscribers.gateway:5060"
            ],
          "policy": "ringall",
          "caller_id": "972123456789",
          "recording": 1,
          "recording_url": "http://my.remote.server.upload.url",
          "intro_music_url": "http://my.music.url/music_file.wav",
          "intro_music_loop": 3,
          "timeout": 120,
          "forward": {
            "status": false,
            "all": "",
            "busy": "2127773456@subscribers.gateway:5060",
            "noanswer": "2127773456@subscribers.gateway:5060"
          },
          "calllimit": 1234,
          }
        ```

        **Notice:** Pay attention that `endpoints` contains a list of possible endpoints, not numbers. Endpoints shall be based upon the endpoint username and the endpoints assigned SIP registration proxy.

        <br/>
        #### Route the call to an IVR endpoint

        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "ivr",
          "endpoints": [
            "12127773456"
            ],
          "caller_id": "972123456789"
          }
        ```
        **Notice:** An IVR endpoint indicates the Vapp server that the IVR application should be invoked, using the IVR access number indicated by the index0 of the `endpoints` array.

        #### Route the call to an internal application endpoint

        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "application",
          "endpoints": [
            "some_applicaiton_name"
            ],
          "caller_id": "972123456789"
          }
        ```
        **Notice:** An application endpoint activates a Vapp builtin application.

        #### Route the call to an external application endpoint

        ```json
          {
          "calltype": "externalapp",
          "endpoints": [
            "accessnumber@externalapp.yourdomain.com"
            ],
          "caller_id": "972123456789"
          }
        ```

        **Notice:** An external application endpoint activates an application via dialing out to a specific SIP server.
